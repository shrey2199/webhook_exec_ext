# Privacy Policy for Webhook Executor

**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026

## Summary

**We do not collect any data from you.** Webhook Executor operates entirely on your device, stores configurations locally, and sends data only to webhook URLs you specify.

## How It Works

When you execute a webhook, the extension processes this data **locally on your device**:

- **Page Information**: URL, title, domain, protocol, selected text
- **Your Configuration**: Webhook URLs, headers, parameters, payload templates
- **Timestamp**: Current date and time

This data is sent **directly from your browser** to **your configured webhook URLs**. We never see, intercept, store, or access any of this information.

## What We DON'T Do

- ❌ Collect, track, or monitor any data
- ❌ Store data on external servers
- ❌ Share or sell your information
- ❌ Log webhook executions

## Your Data & Control

- **Stored Locally**: All configurations use Chrome's storage API on your device
- **You Control**: What webhooks to create, what data to send, when to execute, where to send it
- **Backups**: Export/import features work locally - no external transmission

## Permissions

- **storage**: Save configurations locally
- **activeTab**: Read page data when you trigger a webhook
- **contextMenus**: Add right-click menu options
- **scripting**: Show notification popups
- **<all_urls>**: Send requests to your configured webhook URLs

These permissions activate only when you trigger them - the extension doesn't monitor activity.

## Security & Data Management

- Configurations stored securely via Chrome's API
- HTTPS support when your webhook URLs use HTTPS
- View, export, or delete webhooks anytime in Options
- Uninstall removes all data
